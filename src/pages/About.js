        <p>
          I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Linguistics at Northern Arizona
          University. My research interests lie at the intersection of second
          language prosody and pragmatics. Specifically, I investigate the
          effectiveness of pragma–prosodic training in improving learners’ use
          of prosody in speech acts and the role of cognitive individual
          differences in prosody acquisition. I have also been involved in
          research projects in the domains of speech perception, language
          assessment, and corpus linguistics. For more information about the
          past an current research projects I have been a part of, please visit
          the "Projects" page.

        <p>
          Apart from my work in Applied Linguistics, I enjoy climbing and
          hiking. These hobbies are a given when you live in Flagstaff, AZ!
          Other interests of mine include learning languages (so far, I have
          tackled German, French, and Mandarin), cats, and traveling.
