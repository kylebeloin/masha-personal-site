      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Linguistics at Northern Arizona
        University. My research interests lie at the intersection of second
        language prosody and pragmatics. Specifically, I investigate the
        effectiveness of pragma–prosodic training in improving learners’ use of
        prosody in speech acts and the role of cognitive individual differences
        in prosody acquisition. I have also been involved in research projects
        in the domains of speech perception, language assessment, and corpus
        linguistics. For more information about the past an current research
        projects I have been a part of, please visit the "Projects" page.
      </p>

        Apart from my work in Applied Linguistics, I enjoy climbing and hiking.
        These hobbies are a given when you live in Flagstaff, AZ! Other
        interests of mine include learning languages (so far, I have tackled
        German, French, and Mandarin), cats, and traveling.
