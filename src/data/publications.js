      "The aim of the study was to provide practical advice to restaurant managers for improving star ratings as well as information for researchers on how the pandemic has impacted established determinants of satisfaction. The study examined criteria used by restaurant customers in assigning star-ratings on Yelp during the COVID-19 pandemic using keyword analysis and Multiple Correspondence Analysis. In evaluating restaurants, the reviewers focused on service, overall experience, and food quality. Service was discussed in relation to the pandemic and included safety of the dine-in experience, contrasted with take-out options and compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. These criteria applied differently with lower-star reviews focusing on safety, social distancing, and mask policies. Higher-star reviews focused on take-out/delivery services, high-quality food, and an overall positive experience. The study provides valuable contributions to our understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the restaurant sector in a post-pandemic world.",

      "Despite the efforts of existing studies in the domain of L2 phonology to examine ESL learners' pronunciation development, little research has comprehensively demonstrated ESL learners' pronunciation improvement in academic immersion contexts. Similarly, few studies have focused on learners' proficiency levels linked to their developmental success. The current exploratory study investigated the changes of learners' pronunciation constructs as a result of their ESL program. Seventy-five newly arrived ESL students (25 in each proficiency; beginner, intermediate, and advanced) enrolled in an Intensive English Program in the United States provided their speech responses (to the placement and exit tests from the program). One hundred fifty speaking samples were linguistically analyzed for the following suprasegmental features: fluency (speech rates and pauses) and prosody (prominence and pitch range). Segmental features were analyzed by employing a functional load approach with randomly selected 90 speech files. Findings revealed different developmental patterns among phonological features and proficiency levels; that is, the upper-level learners improved more in fluency and prominence than the lower-level learners. Segmental changes were minimal, suggesting that both high functional and low functional load sounds involve a complex process in learning. Overall findings provide important implications for ESL curriculum planning and development: 1) intonation acquisition can be difficult; 2) skill improvement differs by proficiency level; and 3) level-specific curriculum may be needed.",

      "Elicited imitation tasks (EITs) have been proposed and examined as a practical measure of second language (L2) proficiency. This study aimed to provide an updated and comprehensive view of the relationship between EITs and other proficiency measures. Toward that end, 46 reports were retrieved contributing 60 independent effect sizes (Pearson’s r) that were weighted and averaged. Several EIT features were also examined as potential moderators. The results portray EIT as a generally consistent measure of L2 proficiency (r = .66). Among other moderators, EIT stimuli length was positively associated with stronger correlations. Overall, the findings provide support for the use of EITs as a means to greater consistency and practicality in measuring L2 proficiency. In our Discussion section, we highlight the need for more transparent reporting and provide empirically grounded recommendations for EIT design and for further research into EIT development.",

      "Previous research has established the importance of positive Yelp reviews for the success of independent, non-chain restaurant. While managers may assume that increasing customer satisfaction will increase star rating, previous research on determinants of satisfaction does not necessarily generalize to Yelp reviews or across Yelp star ratings. Accordingly, we used Multiple Correspondence Analysis with a representative sample of 54,000 reviews to investigate the criteria used by reviewers in their assignment of star-ratings to determine if different star-ratings are characterized by different criteria. Our findings confirm previous research showing the importance of service, food, and environment, but suggest these criteria matter differently at different star ratings. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for improving restaurants’ star-ratings: for 1 and 2-star restaurants, avoid long waits, for 3-star restaurants, focus on improving food quality, for 4 and 5-star restaurants, focus on creating a positive overall experience through service, food, and environmental factors.",
