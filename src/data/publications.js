      "This exploratory study examined the intonational patterns and corresponding speech act strategies in L1 and L2 English speakers’ production of high imposition requests and refusals that were elicited using video–based multiple turn discourse completion tasks (DCTs). The participants, 34 L1 American English speakers and 14 high–proficiency L2 English speakers, recorded their oral responses to 10 multiple–turn video–based DCTs. Using Brazil’s (1997) framework, the collected speech samples were analyzed for tone choices in each tone unit. Pragmatic strategies in the produced speech acts were analyzed by adapting the existing coding frameworks (Beebe et al., 1990; Blum–Kulka et al., 1989). The extracted tone choices and lexico–grammatical strategies were compared between the two language groups. The results preliminarily revealed differences in the use of tones by L1 and L2 English speakers in performing requests and refusals. Moreover, while the employed speech act strategies were largely similar between the two speaker groups, the associated tone choices showed contrasting usage patterns..",

      "Lexical bundles are considered a fundamental feature of the register of academic writing and have been extensively studied by corpus linguists. However, while learner corpus-based studies have noted the differences between first (L1) and second languages (L2) in the production of lexical bundles, few of them have assessed the underlying causes of such differences, particularly regarding cross-linguistic transfer. The present study investigates the use of lexical bundles in professional writing in the field of Educational Psychology produced by L1 English and L1 Russian authors in order to evaluate the evidence of cross-linguistic transfer in the writing of L2 English learners with L1 Russian background and examine the patterns of L2 English lexical bundle use that mirror L1 English production. This exploratory study compares the frequency and discourse functions of lexical bundles produced by native speakers of English to those used by Russian speakers in their L2 English professional writing, as well as professional writing in their L1. The results of the study indicate that L2 English writing produced by Russian speakers displays overlap in the composition and use of lexical bundles in L1 Russian writing pointing at possible L1 transfer.

      "Much language attitude research has demonstrated that people make biased judgements based on speakers’ language choice and accent. However, the influence of occupational context on listeners’ perceptions of accented English is largely unknown. This verbal guise study examined to what extent  academic contexts and workforce-related professional contexts affected listeners’ judgements of accented speech. Results revealed that simulated contexts made a significant difference in listeners’ perceptual judgements, with speakers perceived as significantly more comprehensible and acceptable in service-occupational roles than in academic contexts. Findings suggest that listeners’ speech judgements can be heavily influenced by speakers’ situational contexts. The study also provides evidence in support of the fluency principle showing that listeners may evaluate accented speech more negatively if it requires more processing effort. The findings inform the domains of linguistic stereotyping and listeners’ attitudes towards accented speech.",

      description:
        "Prosodic properties of a language bear multiple functions. One of such functions is to signal pragmatic meaning in spoken discourse. Speakers produce various prosodic patterns to achieve communicative goals by placing prominence onto selected syllables, changing the speed of their speech, or using rising, falling, or level tones. This relationship between prosodic patterns and discourse is fundamental to interpreting pragmatic meaning and, as such, has been observed in several pragmatic discourse elements including speech acts, (dis)agreements, and feedback markers by first (L1) and second (L2) language speakers across languages. Although pragmatic functions of prosody are intuitive for L1 speakers, L2 learners are oftentimes unaware of the underlying conventions of prosodic use in a given language. Due to this unintuitive nature of prosody for L2 learners, deviations in learners’ prosodic patterns may be misinterpreted by interlocutors and may have negative pragmatic consequences in a given communicative situation. This chapter defines the relationship between prosody and pragmatics in discourse and provides a brief overview of the current research at the pragma–prosodic interface. It focuses on the prosody of speech acts highlighting differences in L1 and L2 perception and production of prosody. Important constructs related to pragma–prosodic success are highlighted. The chapter concludes with an appraisal of the current literature and an outline of directions for future research and pedagogical applications for L2 instruction.",

The first goal is pursued using a scoping review that surveys existing studies in terms of their quantity, range, and characteristics (e.g., research designs and reporting practices). The second goal is addressed by adopting a small-scale meta-analysis focusing on proficiency as a learner characteristic.",

      "Despite the efforts of existing studies in the domain of L2 phonology to examine ESL learners' pronunciation development, little research has comprehensively demonstrated ESL learners' pronunciation improvement in academic immersion contexts. Similarly, few studies have focused on learners' proficiency levels linked to their developmental success. The current exploratory study investigated the changes of learners' pronunciation constructs as a result of their ESL program. Seventy-five newly arrived ESL students (25 in each proficiency; beginner, intermediate, and advanced) enrolled in an Intensive English Program in the United States provided their speech responses (to the placement and exit tests from the program). One hundred fifty speaking samples were linguistically analyzed for the following suprasegmental features: fluency (speech rates and pauses) and prosody (prominence and pitch range). Segmental features were analyzed by employing a functional load approach with randomly selected 90 speech files. Findings revealed different developmental patterns among phonological features and proficiency levels; that is, the upper-level learners improved more in fluency and prominence than the lower-level learners. Segmental changes were minimal, suggesting that both high functional and low functional load sounds involve a complex process in learning. Overall findings provide important implications for ESL curriculum planning and development: 1) intonation acquisition can be difficult; 2) skill improvement differs by proficiency level; and 3) level-specific curriculum may be needed.",

Toward that end, 46 reports were retrieved contributing 60 independent effect sizes (Pearson’s r) that were weighted and averaged. Several EIT features were also examined as potential moderators. The results portray EIT as a generally consistent measure of L2 proficiency (r = .66). Among other moderators, EIT stimuli length was positively associated with stronger correlations. Overall, the findings provide support for the use of EITs as a means to greater consistency and practicality in measuring L2 proficiency. In our Discussion section, we highlight the need for more transparent reporting and provide empirically grounded recommendations for EIT design and for further research into EIT development.",

In evaluating restaurants, the reviewers focused on service, overall experience, and food quality. Service was discussed in relation to the pandemic and included safety of the dine-in experience, contrasted with take-out options and compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. These criteria applied differently with lower-star reviews focusing on safety, social distancing, and mask policies. Higher-star reviews focused on take-out/delivery services, high-quality food, and an overall positive experience. The study provides valuable contributions to our understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the restaurant sector in a post-pandemic world.",

Accordingly, we used Multiple Correspondence Analysis with a representative sample of 54,000 reviews to investigate the criteria used by reviewers in their assignment of star-ratings to determine if different star-ratings are characterized by different criteria. Our findings confirm previous research showing the importance of service, food, and environment, but suggest these criteria matter differently at different star ratings. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for improving restaurants’ star-ratings: for 1 and 2-star restaurants, avoid long waits, for 3-star restaurants, focus on improving food quality, for 4 and 5-star restaurants, focus on creating a positive overall experience through service, food, and environmental factors.",

The tasks included speech produced by English speakers of the same language background as the listeners, as well as American and British English. Learners also completed an extensive survey that elicited their attitudes towards non-standard English accents in proficiency tests. Exploratory factor analysis of survey responses revealed two contrasting trends in learners’ attitudes. Constructed responses further suggested that while listeners generally preferred prestigious English models (e.g., American English) (over 80%), they also expressed a need for incorporating other accent varieties. The relationships between listeners’ attitudes and their performance on the test were minimal (r < .26). The findings of the study shed light on our understanding of test takers’ needs regarding  accent varieties in listening tests.",

Speakers from four English accent varieties (Chinese, Spanish, Indian English [Hindi] and Korean) produced speech samples for ‘yes/no’ vocabulary and dictation Duolingo listening tasks. Listeners who spoke with these same four English accents were then recruited to take the Duolingo listening test items. Results indicated that there is a shared-L1 benefit effect overall, with comparable test scores between shared-L1 and inner-circle L1 accents, and no significant differences in listeners’ listening performance scores across highly intelligible accent varieties. No task type effect was found. The findings provide guidance to better understand fairness, equality, and practicality of designing and administering high-stakes English tests targeting a diversity of accents.",
